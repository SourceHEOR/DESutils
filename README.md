# Discrete event simulation helpers for health economics


`DESutils` is set of functions in R to execute a discrete event simulation for health economic evaluation efficiently. Installation can be performed using `devtools`:

	library(devtools)
	install_github("SourceHEOR/DESutils")

Or if you have the `githubinstall` package is installed:
	
	library(githubinstall)
	githubinstall("DESutils")
	

Example use cases will be included here soon but are available in the help files for the respective functions.
